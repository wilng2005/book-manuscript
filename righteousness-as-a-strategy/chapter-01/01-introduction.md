# Introduction: Why Righteousness Still Matters

Let’s be clear: the world has always wrestled with a lack of righteousness.

In biblical times, even Israel’s greatest king wasn’t above reproach. After David’s abuse of power—taking Bathsheba and arranging her husband’s death—it was the prophet Nathan who stood before him and told a parable that pierced his conscience. “You are the man,” Nathan declared, confronting the king with his sin (2 Samuel 12). It was a moment of moral reckoning, not just for David, but for the entire kingdom.

Centuries later, in the Roman Republic—one of history’s most admired civilizations—righteousness again gave way to ambition. Once built on ideals of shared governance and civic virtue, the Republic became a playground for manipulation and betrayal. Powerful elites prioritized personal gain over the public good, using bribery and violence to climb the ranks. As integrity eroded, so did trust in the system—until it gave way to empire. The fall wasn’t just political; it was a collapse of righteousness.

In the 16th century, the church itself—once seen as the moral compass of society—became the center of controversy. The selling of indulgences turned forgiveness into a commodity, undermining the spiritual core of Christian faith. Martin Luther’s 95 Theses were not just theological objections; they were a moral outcry against systemic corruption. His stand triggered the Protestant Reformation, shaking the religious and political foundations of Europe. When righteousness is replaced by convenience and control, even sacred institutions are not immune.

In the early 2000s, corporate scandals like Enron and Bernie Madoff showed how the absence of integrity at the top can bring entire systems crashing down.  
Enron, once one of the largest energy companies in the U.S., collapsed in 2001 after it was revealed that executives had used accounting loopholes and shell entities to hide billions in debt. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and retirement savings overnight, and investors were wiped out. It shook public trust in corporate America and led to sweeping reforms in financial regulation.  
Bernie Madoff, on the other hand, ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history—defrauding investors of an estimated $65 billion. From celebrities to charities, people believed they were earning stable returns, when in reality, it was a house of cards. When it finally collapsed in 2008, it devastated lives and left many wondering how such deception had gone undetected for so long.

More recently, the collapse of Indonesian startup eFishery sent shockwaves through Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem. Once celebrated as a unicorn for its innovative aquaculture solutions, eFishery was found to have inflated its revenues by nearly $600 million in the first nine months of 2024. The company’s co-founders maintained dual financial records—one for internal use and another, falsified version for investors. This deception misled major backers, including SoftBank and Temasek. When exposed, it led to mass layoffs and a significant erosion of trust across the region’s startup landscape.

The United States of America—once seen as a bulwark of order and stability—unexpectedly imposed large tariffs on trade, negatively impacting both trade partners and long-standing alliances. This move fractured relationships and undermined trust in the global trade environment.

At the time this book is being written, trust and stability in the world today feel like they are in short supply. Institutions falter, leaders disappoint, and moral lines blur under pressure. In this fractured world, people long for something stable—something trustworthy. That something is *righteousness*—not as a lofty ideal, but as a deeply practical foundation.

## Why Righteousness Often Gets Left Out of Strategy

Perhaps one reason righteousness is not a priority in strategic thinking today is because much of our modern thinking on strategy is borrowed from war.

From *The Art of War* to Clausewitz, and in business books that glorify competitive dominance, war metaphors shape how many leaders think. They emphasize deception, misdirection, and outmaneuvering opponents—tools that make sense in a finite game where the objective is to win, trust is expendable, and the other side is the enemy.

But most of life doesn’t work that way. In business, in leadership, in nation-building, and in personal growth—we are playing *infinite games*. These are arenas where there are no final victories, no ultimate finish lines, and the same players must keep engaging each other over time. In an infinite game, trust is not expendable—it is essential. Integrity isn’t a liability—it’s your long-term edge.

When we treat every challenge as a battle to be won, we neglect the deeper structures that make sustainable success possible: credibility, trust, and moral alignment. And because war strategy is glorified in pop culture, business school case studies, and startup culture, many leaders are never taught to see integrity as strategic. They’re taught to win.

This book offers a different path—not one that rejects strategy, but one that reclaims it. A strategy built on righteousness isn’t naïve. It’s wiser. It lasts longer. And in the long run, it wins where other strategies burn out.

## Righteousness as more than moral correctness—it’s strategic

We often treat righteousness as a private virtue or a moral checkbox. Something personal. Internal. Optional. But what if it’s more than that? What if doing what’s right is also the most strategic move you can make?

In business, righteousness builds credibility. People remember leaders who tell the truth, honor their word, and do right by their teams and customers. Trust becomes a competitive advantage—one that compounds over time. In leadership, righteousness inspires loyalty. Teams rally around leaders who protect the vulnerable, share credit, and take responsibility when things go wrong. These leaders don’t have to demand respect—they earn it.

And in relationships—whether personal or professional—righteousness creates safety. It sets a foundation for long-term connection. It says, “You can count on me to do what’s right, not just what’s easy.”

One striking example of righteousness as strategy is Singapore. In the decades following independence, the nation made a deliberate choice to root its governance in integrity. With strict anti-corruption policies implemented at highest levels, Singapore transformed from a developing port city into one of the world’s most trusted and stable economies. Investors came. Institutions flourished. Citizens began to trust that the system would work—not perfectly, but consistently and fairly.  
It wasn’t just good governance. It was a strategic move built on moral clarity. And it worked.

Righteousness isn’t about being flawless. It’s about being diligent and faithful. It means choosing the harder path of integrity over the shortcut of convenience. And ironically, that harder path often turns out to be the wisest, most durable, and most fruitful one in the long run.

In a world obsessed with public opinion, efficiency, speed, and results, righteousness slows things down—but in the best possible way. It roots you. Anchors you. And over time, it wins.


## The Trap of Self-Righteousness

But here’s the danger: righteousness, when self-proclaimed, can easily turn into something else entirely.

The moment we start seeing ourselves as the righteous ones—as the moral center in the room—we risk becoming blind to our own faults. What begins as integrity can quietly harden into pride. We start believing we’re above correction, above failure. And that’s when righteousness becomes dangerous—not a force for good, but a mask for arrogance.

History is full of people who claimed to stand for what’s right, yet left harm in their wake. Take Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, who positioned herself as a revolutionary reformer in healthcare. She spoke of values, purpose, and saving lives—while knowingly misleading investors and endangering patients with a technology that didn’t work. Her moral language masked deception.

Or consider Ravi Zacharias, a globally respected Christian apologist, whose public teachings on truth and virtue inspired millions. After his death, investigations revealed years of sexual misconduct, manipulation, and abuse—enabled in part by the aura of righteousness surrounding him. The very systems that should have held him accountable instead protected him, blinded by the belief that someone so “righteous” could do no wrong.

That’s why true righteousness must be paired with deep humility. It requires an unwavering grasp of this truth: no one has a monopoly on what is right. And anyone who claims to should be scrutinized even more, not less.

Righteousness isn’t about being the hero. It’s about being accountable. It doesn’t claim moral superiority—it embraces moral responsibility.

#### What Do We Mean by “Righteousness” and “Strategy”?

**Righteousness**, in this book, doesn’t mean moral superiority or religious piety. It means doing what is right—especially when it’s inconvenient, costly, or unpopular. It’s about integrity, fairness, courage, humility, and accountability—qualities that build trust over time. Righteousness isn’t rigid rule-following; it’s about aligning our actions with enduring values, even when no one is watching.

**Strategy** refers to the deliberate pursuit of outcomes through leveraging strategic insight. Strategic insight is a belief about the world—something true, yet often overlooked or underused. The core thesis of this book is that righteousness, often dismissed as a moral ideal, is actually a method of maintaining *maximum sustainable leverage*. 

This book is a journey in bringing the two together—at the level of nations, organizations, businesses, families, and individuals—arguing that righteousness isn’t just the right thing to do, but the *smartest* thing to do in the long run. Not just morally sound, but strategically wise.


## The Journey Ahead

This book explores righteousness not just as a personal virtue, but as a validated framework for strategy, leadership, influence, and long-term impact. Along the way, we’ll look at what happens when righteousness is present—and what happens when it’s absent. We’ll examine how integrity shapes outcomes in the boardroom, in government, in communities, and in everyday life.

We’ll also explore the seven foundations of effective strategy which serve as a compass to navigate uncertainties. You’ll encounter stories of how leaders and individuals stood firm when it counted—and those who didn’t. Some will inspire you. Others will caution you.

We’ll also explore the hidden dangers: the pride that can take root in good intentions, the systems that protect the powerful, and the slow erosion of values in the name of results. You’ll be challenged not just to do what’s right, but to do it with humility, accountability, and courage.

This isn’t a call to perfection. It’s a call to alignment—to live and lead in a way that is both good and wise, principled and effective. Righteousness still matters. Let's begin.
