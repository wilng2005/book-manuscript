# Chapter 13: Case Study 1 – Theranos

## I. The Promise and the Hype

In the early 2010s, Silicon Valley was abuzz with the story of a young entrepreneur who seemed poised to revolutionize healthcare. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of Theranos, promised a future where a single drop of blood could unlock a world of medical insights. No more painful needles, no more waiting days for lab results—just a quick finger prick, and dozens of tests run instantly on a compact, elegant device.

The vision was as bold as it was inspiring. Holmes spoke of democratizing healthcare, making diagnostics accessible and affordable for everyone, everywhere. She invoked the language of mission and morality, framing Theranos not just as a business, but as a crusade to save lives and empower patients. “We’re doing this for humanity,” she would say, her voice steady and unwavering, her eyes fixed on a future only she seemed able to see.

Investors, politicians, and the media were captivated. Holmes graced the covers of Fortune, Forbes, and Time. She was hailed as the next Steve Jobs, a visionary who would change the world. Theranos attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from some of the most respected names in business and government. The company’s board included former secretaries of state, senators, and military leaders—people who lent not just credibility, but a sense of moral authority to the enterprise.

The hype was electric. Walgreens and Safeway signed on as partners, eager to bring Theranos technology to their customers. The company’s valuation soared to nearly $10 billion. For a moment, it seemed as if the future of medicine had arrived.

But beneath the surface, the reality was far more complicated. The promise of Theranos was built on a foundation of secrecy, wishful thinking, and, ultimately, deception. The very qualities that made the company so compelling—its grand vision, its moral rhetoric, its aura of inevitability—would soon become the seeds of its downfall.
